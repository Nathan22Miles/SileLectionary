The Kingdom of Lanna (Northern Thai: <font family="Lanna Alif">ᩋᩣᨱᩣᨧᩢᨠᩕᩃ᩶ᩣ᩠ᨶᨶᩣ</font>, lit. "Kingdom of Million Rice Fields"; Thai: อาณาจักรล้านนา; Burmese: <font family="Padauk">ဇင်းမယ် ပြည်, </font>IPA: [zɪ́ɴmɛ̀ pjì]) was a kingdom centered in present-day northern Thailand from the 13th to 18th centuries. The cultural development of the people of Lanna, the Tai Yuan people, had begun long before as successive Tai Yuan kingdoms preceded Lanna. As a continuation of the Ngoenyang kingdom, Lanna emerged strong enough in the 15th century to rival the Ayutthaya kingdom, with whom wars were fought. However, Lanna was weakened and then became a Burmese tributary state in 1558. Lanna was ruled by successive vassal kings, though some enjoyed autonomy. The Burmese rule gradually withdrew but then resumed as the new Konbaung dynasty expanded Burmese influences. Taksin of Thonburi finally took Lanna in 1775 and broke it down into a number of tributary kingdoms.
